# 3D-renderer-C
A simple CPU-based 3D renderer written in C using the SDL2 library.

Inspired by Tsoding’s video *“One Formula That Demystifies 3D Graphics”*.  
It follows basically the same logic, but implemented in C using SDL2.

All the functions that perform linear transformations, vector normalization, and draw the wireframe are implemented from scratch, using only an SDL surface context and `SDL_Rect` structures to manipulate pixels on the screen.
